# C Programming Challenge - Level 1

This mini-challenge is intended to test your knowledge of C programming. There are 13 C programming questions that can be found in the challenge.c file. Your solution to this challenge will be verified automatically on a standard Linux machine once you make a pull request.

If you'd like to test your solution locally, make sure you have Make and GCC for your system installed.

To test your solution, run:
```sh
make clean
make all
./build/challenge # Or ./build/challenge.exe on Windows
```

If you've answered all the questions correctly, you'll pass all the test cases. There should be zero build errors/warnings.
