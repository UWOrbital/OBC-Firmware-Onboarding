# C Programming Challenge - Level 1

This mini-challenge is intended to test your knowledge of C programming. There are 13 C programming questions that can be found in the challenge.c file. Your solution to this challenge will be verified automatically on a standard Linux machine once you make a pull request.

To test your solutions locally, you can use the provided Dockerfile to build a Docker image that will run the tests for you.
 
To build the Docker image, run:
```
docker build -t fw-onboarding-level1 .
```

To run the tests, run:
```
docker run --rm -it fw-onboarding-level1
```

If you've answered all the questions correctly, you'll pass all the test cases. There should be zero build errors/warnings.
